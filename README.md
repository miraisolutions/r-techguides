`techguides` is an open source project to collect technical guidelines and best practices. At [Mirai Solutions](https://mirai-solutions.ch) we envision `techguides` as a dynamic and evolving project where we can share with the community some of the experience we gather in our daily work.

The current version of `techguides`, a [bookdown](https://github.com/rstudio/bookdown) website served via [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com), can be browsed at https://mirai-solutions.ch/techguides.
